# Session-local Schedule

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Schedule and time-context ship in the default Web composition. This overlay remains the documented `--patch` path for older checkouts and for the schedule-after e2e harness; it is intentionally empty so Loader does not see duplicate `time-context` / `schedule` entry ids:

```sh
dsh web --patch examples/web-schedule/cordis.yml
```

The shipped host plugin supports reminders created with a positive whole-number `after_seconds`, an absolute `at` target, a fixed-rate `every_seconds` interval of at least 300 seconds, or a 5-field `cron` expression. The model manages them through `schedule_create`, `schedule_list`, `schedule_delete`, `schedule_update`, `schedule_pause`, `schedule_resume`, and `schedule_run_now`; every result identifies delivery as `session-local`.

The browser attaches its IANA zone to each prompt. Time-context tells the model to interpret otherwise-unqualified dates and times in that request's browser zone. This assumption belongs to natural-language interpretation only: `schedule_create.at` must be either a strict RFC 3339 date-time with `Z` or a numeric offset, or `{ date, time, time_zone }` with an explicit `UTC` or IANA Area/Location zone. Schedule does not retain or infer a Session default zone. Daylight-saving gaps are rejected, overlaps choose the first instant, and successful records keep only the resulting UTC target.

The original Session log owns each reminder. A live root Agent waits until it is fully idle, then queues a normal follow-up turn in that conversation. It never steers current work and adds no separate receipt or reminder card. Closing the process or leaving the Session cold stops its in-memory timer without deleting the record; reopening that same Session restores the wait and delivers an overdue reminder. Reading cold history never activates it, and a fork does not inherit its parent's reminders.

Every reminders stay aligned to their creation time. If one is overdue, only its latest due occurrence is presented and the next target remains on the original fixed-rate sequence. All distinct Every records overdue at the same idle decision are combined into one follow-up with one occurrence each; missed intervals do not create a backlog. Due one-shots run before that batch.

Create and actual delete operations acknowledge success only after Session persistence confirms their event prefix. Schedule does not provide browser, operating-system, email, SMS, or other external notification. A durable dispatch records that the follow-up was queued; it does not acknowledge model success or user receipt.
